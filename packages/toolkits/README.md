# Activetoolkits

This package manages the toolkits available to Smart Contract Developers

#### Available Toolkits 

1. HTTP - Safe export of [ActiveRequest](https://github.com/activeledger/activeledger/blob/master/packages/utilities/src/request.ts)

2. pdfmake - Contract enhanced compiled version of [pdfmake](https://github.com/bpampuch/pdfmake)

##### Coming Soon

New libraries will be created and added as a toolkit as they become available. These range from real-time integration with crypto currencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple etc) to CRM / ERP systems. The purpose of these toolkits is to remove the need of Oracle services to interact with third party software.
