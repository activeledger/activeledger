# Activeledger Changelog

## [2.11.8]

### Feature

## [2.11.7]

### Feature
* **Core** : Allow Core to create Volatile Memory.

## [2.11.6]

### Fix
* **Crypto** : 0x prefix adding correctly to all public key instances.

## [2.11.5]

### Fix
* **Crypto** : Add compressed Public EC Support

## [2.11.3]

### Read Only Fix
* **Protocol** : Read Only doesn't require signatures and this resolves the issue of assumed signatures exist.

## [2.11.2]

### Prefix Fix
* **Protocol** : Converts any siganture references with prefixes to normal size so access to authorities is working again.

## [2.11.1]

### Storage Fix
* **Storage** : Self host database now has internal counters preventing runaway restarts for unexpected errors.

## [2.11.0]

### Security Fix
* **Protocol** : vm2 security dependency updated. Resolves published security issues that doesn't impact Activeledger contract runtime.

## [2.10.2]

### Bug Fix
* **Protocol / Network** : Upgrade contracts refreshes cache asap. (No longer waits for timeouts)

## [2.10.1]

### Bug Fix
* **Protocol** : Upgrade contracts now refresh all processor caches to always run the latest (If selected as default)
* **Restore** : Sometimes an error is raised incorrectly and the restore engine fails to handle it, Now has default values instead of crashes. 

## [2.10.0]

### Feature
* **Storage** : Removed the Btree revision history in the storage engine. This change is backwards compatible for the read and upgrades on write. This feature will increase overall system performance and also improve the reliability of the written data. History is still preserved due to the :umid records and the :stream transaction array list.

## [2.9.1]

### Bug Fix
* **Contract** : Volatile data only gets saved when a change is detected.

## [2.9.0]

### Features
* **Activeledger:** Virtual prefixes for Activity Streams (Identities). These are managed at the transaction level. If a new stream is created it will use the first found virtual prefix. It will keep the same prefixes upon updates.

## [2.8.1]

### Bug Fix
* **Protocol** : New method to select latest version by targeting and tracking semver. Can be overidden by transaction $contract targetting itself with contractid@version.

## [2.8.0]

### Features
* **Activeledger:** Flush old archives with --flush flag this will reduce space. Best to setup and run periodically.
* **Activeledger:** Read Only transaction support. These transactions do not require any signatures and are invoked by having no $i provided. By default it will call read() but this can be changed with the $entry of the transaction payload.
* **Protocol** : Upgraded contracts are removed from resolver cache.
* **Contract** : Verify phase is now optional.

#### Example Read-only transaction
```json
{
    "$tx": {
        "$namespace": "namespace",
        "$contract": "contract id",
        "$entry":"readMe" // Will call the method readMe() found in the contract
    }
}
```

### Bug Fix
* **Definitions** : Faster transaction schema validation.

        "vote": 0,
        "commit": 0,
